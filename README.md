This file contains implementation of three task based on Lidar and camera data set.

1. Calculating the car dimension using Lidar data.
2. Comparing the resolution of velodyne and Blickfield Lidar, benchmarking it on that basis.
3. Algorithm for path prediction based on bounding box data and regression algorithm.

The attached PDF explains the scenerio in detail you can go through it in case if detailed explanation.

The dataset used is not added as it is not owned by me, in case you are interested please contact me.
